An Internet Radio is capable of streaming audio from the internet. We have used a microcontroller (in this case, Raspberry Pi) to make a wireless Internet Radio. We have used mpc, a client for mpd (music player daemon), to fetch audio streams and play them.

The 'links.txt' has the list of audio streams that need to be played (this can be modified). The 'add_station.py' adds the audio streams in the 'links.txt' file to the playlist.
